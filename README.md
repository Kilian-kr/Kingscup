# Kingscup

## Welcome to Kingscup, a digital version of the popular drinking game!

In this repository, you'll find the code for the Kingscup web application, which allows you to play the game with your friends online. The game is based on a set of rules that are usually printed on cards, and which involve players taking turns drawing cards and performing the actions associated with them.
Getting started

To play Kingscup, you'll need to have a web browser installed on your computer or mobile device. You can access the game by visiting the following URL: https://apps.kraatz.me/kingscup

Once you're on the website, you can create a new game by clicking on the "New Game" button. This will generate a unique game code that you can share with your friends. They can then enter the code on the website to join the game.
## Rules

The rules of Kingscup are simple:

    Each player takes turns drawing a card from the deck.
    Each card has a specific action associated with it. These actions can vary depending on the version of the game you're playing, but some common examples include:
        "Waterfall": All players start drinking at the same time, and can't stop until the person to their left stops.
        "Thumbmaster": The person who draws the card becomes the Thumbmaster, and can put their thumb on the table at any time. The other players must follow suit, and the last person to do so must drink.
        "Categories": The person who draws the card picks a category (e.g. types of fruit), and everyone takes turns naming items from that category. The first person who can't think of an item must drink.
    The game continues until all the cards have been drawn, or until the players decide to end it.
